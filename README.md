### About Spotify

Spotify is a digital music and podcast streaming service that provides access to millions of songs and podcasts from artists all over the world. The platform allows users to search for and play music, create and share playlists, discover new music based on their listening habits, and more. Everything you see in Spotify, you will certainly see in Mellofy and more!

### Features

* Edit your playlist picture, title and followers easyly.
* Add friend as listerns to your playlist so they can enjoy it to! Every change youll make in your playlist will be updated to your friends in real time using web sockets.

### Technologies

The technnology stack I used is MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.
I used webSockets to enable real-time updates for all users. API calls to the backend are done with REST API method.
In addition, I have incorporated third-side libraries, such as React beautiful D&D, React-YouTube and more.
the App's layout was made with Sass (functions, mixins, variables).

#### Chat App / Forum

As i tried to make something other then only spotify clone, I have implemented a custom Form/Chat in the app. both registered users and guests can participate in discussions by asking questions, responding to other questions, and liking others' answers, with real-time updates.

#### And on Mobile!

A taste of the mobile experience. I have used mixins, rem and em units, aspect ratio and more, to make Mellofy responsive with minimun effort.
